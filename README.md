# YT-Win
**A simple, rigid frontend for youtube-dl (yt-dl.org) made with C# and WPF.**

This code is probably not the best out there if I'm being honest. But that
doesn't matter. It works, and it helped me learn a lot about .NET, C# and WPF.

**Prerequisites**
You will need:
- A windows computer (This might work with Mono or Wine on Linux, I don't know)
- youtube-dl (Install from https://yt-dl.org)
- ffmpeg (Install from https://ffmpeg.org)
- Low expectations (I made this to do one thing and one thing only. It's very
simple, and there are almost no settings to change.)

**FAQ**
Q: Why didn't you bundle youtube-dl and ffmpeg with this program?
A: youtube-dl is updated often to continue to be able to work and I was one, not wanting to update this
ever again, and two, not sure how to do that because I am a coding novice and very new to the world of open-source (At the time of making this, anyway).
